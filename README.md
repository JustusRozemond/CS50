# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

The project has 4 web-pages:
1) index.html (not so interesting, with a very short readme about the project;
2) contact.html: also not so interesting, just to make the numbers, really;
3) aboutme.html: I spent a bit more time on this. It has a stylized lay-out and a table. Shows you who I am, with a @media-query to show/hide a picture of me. Could be of interest, due to my unusual life :-)
4) youtune.html: this will eventually turn into a web-application that I intend to buid. Without giving away too much, this would be an "ear-trainer", to train musicians to analyse tuning in music. For now it's just a mock-up, with many components not yet "live". 

Here's where to find the required items:
*) 4 Different pages: index.html, contact.html, aboutme.html, youtune.html, all hyper-linked to index.html.
*) lists: the ToDo list in youtune.html and "jump to" list in aboutme.html
*) stylesheet file: styles.css, based on styles.scss
*) 5 CSS properties: color, background-color, font-selector, margin-top, border-collapse, width, padding, etc, etc
*) 5 5 CSS selectors: head, style, html, p, h1, h2, etc
*) #id selector: used for the table in aboutme.html
*) .class selector: used for the mock-up app in youtune.html
*) @media query: makes picture show/disappear in aboutme.html
*) bootstrap4 components: there's a few hyperlink buttons in contact.html and youtune.html
*) bootstrap column use: used to structure the todo list in youtune.html
*) SCSS variables: used to define the main font and background colours
*) SCSS nesting: used in the table definition in the scss file
*) SCSS inheritance (used for fonts in scss file)
