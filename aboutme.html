		<h2 id="aboutme_section1"> Justus Rozemond and computer programming </h2>
		<p>
		Justus studied geophysics at the University of Utrecht in the eighties.
		As part of these studies, he had his first programming experiences.
		Having narrowly missed the era of the punch-cards (which he did play with, as a child), his first programming took place on a computer without a screen, but connected to a line printer.
		To look at your code, you had to print out the whole program, or, to save paper, only the bit you were working on.
		The standard programming language at the time was Pascal.</p>
		<p>
		In the early nineties, Justus worked as a research geophysicist with a major oil company.
		A large part of his work involved pretty heavy coding within a proprietary seismic data processing package.
		Along with weather prediction, 3D seismic processing counted as the most data-intensive computing task in the world, so efficient coding (both in terms of CPU usage and data I/O) of complex mathematical operations was the name of the game.
		Most of his programming took place in Fortran 77, first on a VAX/VMS operating system, and later in Unix.
		From time to time, he was allowed to have his computations run on the Cray supercomputer, the Rolls Royce of computers worldwide at the time.</p>
		<p>
		Justus continued working as a geophysicist in different capacities, where programming was less important.
		In his spare time he worked on various hobby projects, including writing a snooker program, which involved full computation of the interaction of a complex system of 21 moving and colliding spheres.
		Programming the graphics, in these pre-Windows days, was a major challenge, but also the most fun.
		Programming took place using the Turbo-Pascal IDE.</p>
		<p>
		At the beginning of the century, Justus worked on other hobby projects, including a seismic simulator, to measure the effiency of a 3D seismic crew through simulation of its complex logisitics.
		By this time, Justus had moved to Delphi, another IDE environment using Pascal, but based on object-oriented principles.
		On the latter, Justus freely admits that he just never quite 'got it', although he learned to work with GUI components and with event-driven programs rather than sequential ones.</p>
		<p>
		After leaving geophysics in 2004, programming mostly disappeared from Justus's life.
		More than 10 years later, in 2015, he was awarded the Virgil Kauffman award by the Society of Exploration Geophysicists, for an influential geophysical invention he had made all the way back in 1995.</p>
		<p>
		In 2020, the Covid-19 crisis prompted Justus to take the on-line CS50 course from Harvard University, where he learned the basics of Python.
		His first impressions: loving the way indenting is handled, but not yet sold on the idea you don't have to declare your variables.</p>
		<p>
	  Alltogether, Justus considers himself an experienced programmer, although hopelessly out of touch with the internet-driven present day programming environment.</p>

		<h2 id="aboutme_section3"> Justus Rozemond and music </h2>
		<p>
		At 5 years old, Justus had piano lessons, after which his teacher proclaimed him "unfit for music".
		A few years later he picked up the violin, and after starting to play in youth orchestras, classical music became one of the main elements of his life.</p>
		<p>
		Having traveled the world as a geophysicist (with postings in The Netherlands, Oman, England, Scotland and New Zealand) he decided to have a change of scenery, and enrolled in a Music Performance major at the New Zealand School of Music.
		By this time, Justus had converted to the clarinet, after a fall off his bike had forced him to temporarily abandon the violin.</p>
		<p>
	  After finishing his studies, Justus moved to Tauranga.
	  Most of his musical activities now consist of conducting various orchestras in the area.
		He also spends considerable time arranging and typesetting orchestral music.
		From time to time he plays clarinet in chamber music projects and regional orchestras.</p>
