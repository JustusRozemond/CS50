		<h2>About this site </h2>
		<p>
		This web-site was made as part as an assignment for the on-line CS50W course.
		It does not serve a purpose other than demonstrating basic proficiency with HTML coding and associated tools.
		It is not expected to be used past this course.</p>
		<p>
		However, there is one page (YouTune!), which is intended to be the starting point of a web-based application that Justus Rozemond intends to build on completion of the CS50W course.
		Although this particular application is not finished yet (it will require more detailed Python coding), it is the bit that eventually will become the most interesting.
